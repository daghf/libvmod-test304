Varnish test304 Module
----------------------

:Author: Dag Haavi Finstad

:Version: 1.0
:Manual section: 3

SYNOPSIS
========

import test304;

DESCRIPTION
===========

Lets you detect if the current response will end up as a 304 Not
Modified. Must only be used in vcl_deliver.

The 304 logic in Varnish depends on whether or not any of the relevant
headers were altered in vcl_deliver, so in general we can't know until
after vcl_deliver if this response will end up as a 304.

To rely on the result from the test304() function, you must not alter
either of the following after the call::
  
  req.http.if-modified-since
  req.http.if-none-match

Varnish uses the headers of the fetched object (not the copy in
resp.http.*) when deciding if it will do a 304, so stripping off
resp.http.etag or resp.http.last-modified in vcl_deliver will prevent
the client from seeing these, but will not prevent Varnish from
serving a 304.

FUNCTIONS
=========

test304
-------

Prototype
        ::

                test304()
Return value
	BOOL
Description
	Returns true if this response will end up as a 304. Do not 
	invoke this from outside of vcl_deliver.
Example
        ::

	   sub vcl_deliver {
	       if (test304.test304()) {
	           set resp.http.foo = "this is a 304";
	       }
	   }



INSTALLATION
============

The source tree is based on autotools to configure the building, and
does also have the necessary bits in place to do functional unit tests
using the varnishtest tool.

Usage::

 autoreconf -vif
 ./configure VARNISHSRC=DIR [VMODDIR=DIR]

`VARNISHSRC` is the directory of the Varnish source tree for which to
compile your vmod. Both the `VARNISHSRC` and `VARNISHSRC/include`
will be added to the include search paths for your module.

Optionally you can also set the vmod install directory by adding
`VMODDIR=DIR` (defaults to the pkg-config discovered directory from your
Varnish installation).

Make targets:

* make - builds the vmod
* make install - installs your vmod in `VMODDIR`
* make check - runs the unit tests in ``src/tests/*.vtc``
